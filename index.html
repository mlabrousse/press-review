  <h1>Harvard : a huge university</h1>
  <p>Harvard is a University which is known all over<br>
    the world due to its reputation. In fact, Harvard<br>
    is a University which has 24 masters and 1 bachelor<br>
    degrees. Also, Harvard is top 5 of the Universities<br>
    World Rankings. This University is really well known,<br>
    but, it costs also a lot of money. It depends of what<br>
    diploma are you working for, but, in average, it costs<br>
    $90.000 a year (less or more). It is really a lot of money,<br>
    but, Harvard can give you a scholarship if you have good results.<br> 
    On the Harvard campus, you have cafeterias, gyms, and shops. When<br>
    you pay for your meal plan, you can eat in the dining halls as much<br>
    as you want, but access to the gyms requires a separate membership<br>
    and shops are not included according to Harvard website. For the admission,<br>
    you first need to choose your programme because there is a lot school<br>
    programmes like in medicines etc. There is a dead line : 1st November<br>
    is for Early Action and it’s the 1st January for the Regular Decision.<br>
    Harvard looks also at grades, test scores etc.
